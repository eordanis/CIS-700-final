Once upon a midnight dreary,Negative
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,Neutral
While I nodded,Neutral
As of some one gently rapping,Neutral
"'Tis some visitor, I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door-",Neutral
"                 Only this, and nothing more.""",Neutral
Ah,Neutral
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.,Negative
Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow,Neutral
From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-,Neutral
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-,Neutral
                 Nameless here for evermore.,Neutral
And the silken,Neutral
Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;,Neutral
So that now,Neutral
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
                 This it is, and nothing more.",Neutral
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,Neutral
"Sir, said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;",Neutral
But the fact is I was napping,Positive
And so faintly you came tapping,Neutral
"That I scarce was sure I heard you""- here I opened wide the door;-",Neutral
                 Darkness there,Neutral
Deep into that darkness peering,Neutral
Doubting,Neutral
But the silence was unbroken,Neutral
"And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""",Neutral
"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""-",Neutral
                 Merely this,Neutral
Back into the chamber turning,Neutral
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.,Neutral
"Surely, said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice:",Neutral
Let me see,Neutral
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-,Neutral
"                 'Tis the wind and nothing more!""",Neutral
Open here I flung the shutter,Neutral
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;,Neutral
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;,Neutral
But,Neutral
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-,Neutral
                 Perched,Neutral
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,Neutral
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.,Neutral
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, I said, ""art sure no craven,",Neutral
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-,Neutral
"Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!""",Neutral
"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""",Neutral
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Neutral
Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;,Neutral
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being,Neutral
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-,Neutral
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,Neutral
"With such name as ""Nevermore.""",Neutral
But the Raven,Neutral
That one word,Neutral
Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-,Neutral
"Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before-",Neutral
"On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""",Neutral
"Then the bird said, ""Nevermore.""",Neutral
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,Negative
"Doubtless, said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,",Neutral
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster,Negative
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-,Neutral
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore,Neutral
"Of 'Never- nevermore'.""",Neutral
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,Neutral
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird,Neutral
Then upon the velvet sinking,Neutral
Fancy unto fancy,Neutral
What this grim,Negative
"Meant in croaking ""Nevermore.""",Negative
This I sat engaged in guessing,Neutral
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;,Negative
This and more I sat divining,Positive
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,Positive
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,Positive
She shall press,Positive
Then methought the air grew denser,Neutral
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.,Neutral
"Wretch, I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he hath sent thee",Neutral
Respite- respite and nepenthe,Neutral
"Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!""",Neutral
"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""",Neutral
"Prophet! said I, ""thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -",Neutral
Whether Tempter sent,Neutral
Desolate yet all undaunted,Neutral
On this home by Horror haunted- tell me truly,Neutral
"Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!""",Neutral
"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""",Neutral
"Prophet! said I, ""thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!",Neutral
By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-,Neutral
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if,Neutral
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-,Neutral
"Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.""",Neutral
"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""",Neutral
Be that word our sign in parting,Neutral
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!",Neutral
"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""",Neutral
And the Raven,Neutral
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;,Neutral
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,Negative
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;,Neutral
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted- nevermore!,Negative
From childhood's hour I have not been,Negative
As others were -- I have not seen,Neutral
As others saw -- I could not bring,Neutral
My passions from a common spring --,Positive
From the same source I have not taken,Neutral
My sorrow -- I could not awaken,Neutral
My heart to joy at the same tone --,Neutral
And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --,Neutral
Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn,Neutral
Of a most stormy life -- was drawn,Negative
From ev'ry depth of good and ill,Neutral
The mystery which binds me still --,Neutral
From the torrent,Neutral
From the red cliff of the mountain --,Neutral
From the sun that 'round me roll'd,Neutral
In its autumn tint of gold --,Positive
From the lightning in the sky,Neutral
As it pass'd me flying by --,Neutral
From the thunder,Neutral
Lo! Death has reared himself a throne,Negative
In a strange city lying alone,Neutral
"Far down within the dim West,",Neutral
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best,Neutral
Have gone to their eternal rest.,Neutral
There shrines and palaces and towers,Neutral
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!),Neutral
Resemble nothing that is ours.,Negative
"Around, by lifting winds forgot,",Neutral
Resignedly beneath the sky,Neutral
The melancholy waters lie.,Neutral
No rays from the holy heaven come down,Neutral
On the long night-time of that town;,Neutral
But light from out the lurid sea,Neutral
Streams up the turrets silently-,Neutral
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free-,Neutral
Up domes- up spires- up kingly halls-,Neutral
Up fanes- up Babylon-like walls-,Neutral
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers,Positive
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-,Neutral
Up many and many a marvellous shrine,Neutral
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine,Neutral
"The viol, the violet, and the vine.",Neutral
Resignedly beneath the sky,Neutral
The melancholy waters lie.,Neutral
So blend the turrets and shadows there,Neutral
"That all seem pendulous in air,",Neutral
While from a proud tower in the town,Neutral
Death looks gigantically down.,Neutral
There open fanes and gaping graves,Neutral
Yawn level with the luminous waves;,Neutral
But not the riches there that lie,Neutral
In each idol's diamond eye-,Neutral
Not the gaily-jewelled dead,Neutral
Tempt the waters from their bed;,Neutral
"For no ripples curl, alas!",Neutral
Along that wilderness of glass-,Neutral
No swellings tell that winds may be,Neutral
Upon some far-off happier sea-,Neutral
No heavings hint that winds have been,Neutral
On seas less hideously serene.,Neutral
"But lo, a stir is in the air!",Neutral
The wave- there is a movement there!,Neutral
"As if the towers had thrust aside,",Neutral
"In slightly sinking, the dull tide-",Neutral
As if their tops had feebly given,Neutral
A void within the filmy Heaven.,Neutral
The waves have now a redder glow-,Neutral
The hours are breathing faint and low-,Neutral
"And when, amid no earthly moans,",Neutral
"Down, down that town shall settle hence,",Neutral
"Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,",Neutral
Shall do it reverence.,Neutral
"At midnight, in the month of June,",Neutral
I stand beneath the mystic moon.,Neutral
"An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,",Neutral
"Exhales from out her golden rim,",Neutral
"And, softly dripping, drop by drop,",Neutral
"Upon the quiet mountain top,",Negative
Steals drowsily and musically,Neutral
Into the universal valley.,Negative
The rosemary nods upon the grave;,Neutral
The lily lolls upon the wave;,Neutral
"Wrapping the fog about its breast,",Neutral
The ruin molders into rest;,Neutral
"Looking like Lethe, see! the lake",Neutral
"A conscious slumber seems to take,",Neutral
"And would not, for the world, awake.",Neutral
All Beauty sleeps!- and lo! where lies,Negative
"Irene, with her Destinies!",Negative
"O, lady bright! can it be right-",Neutral
This window open to the night?,Negative
"The wanton airs, from the tree-top,",Positive
Laughingly through the lattice drop-,Positive
"The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,",Positive
"Flit through thy chamber in and out,",Positive
And wave the curtain canopy,Neutral
So fitfully- so fearfully-,Neutral
Above the closed and fringed lid,Neutral
"'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,",Neutral
"That, o'er the floor and down the wall,",Neutral
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!,Neutral
"Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?",Neutral
Why and what art thou dreaming here?,Neutral
"Sure thou art come O'er far-off seas,",Neutral
A wonder to these garden trees!,Neutral
"Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress,",Neutral
"Strange, above all, thy length of tress,",Neutral
And this all solemn silentness!,Neutral
"The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,",Neutral
"Which is enduring, so be deep!",Neutral
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!,Neutral
"This chamber changed for one more holy,",Neutral
"This bed for one more melancholy,",Neutral
I pray to God that she may lie,Neutral
"For ever with unopened eye,",Neutral
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!,Neutral
"My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep",Neutral
"As it is lasting, so be deep!",Neutral
Soft may the worms about her creep!,Negative
"Far in the forest, dim and old,",Neutral
For her may some tall vault unfold-,Negative
Some vault that oft has flung its black,Negative
"And winged panels fluttering back,",Neutral
"Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,",Neutral
Of her grand family funerals-,Positive
"Some sepulchre, remote, alone,",Neutral
"Against whose portal she hath thrown,",Neutral
"In childhood, many an idle stone-",Neutral
Some tomb from out whose sounding door,Neutral
"She ne'er shall force an echo more,",Neutral
"Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!",Negative
It was the dead who groaned within.,Neutral
"For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,",Neutral
"Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,",Neutral
"Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies",Neutral
"Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.",Neutral
Search narrowly the lines! -- they hold a treasure,Positive
Divine -- a talisman -- an amulet,Neutral
That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure --,Neutral
The words -- the syllables! Do not forget,Neutral
"The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!",Positive
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot,Positive
"Which one might not undo without a sabre,",Positive
If one could merely comprehend the plot.,Negative
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering,Negative
"Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdu,",Negative
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing,Positive
"Of poets, by poets -- as the name is a poet's, too.",Positive
"Its letters, although naturally lying",Positive
Like the knight Pinto -- Mendez Ferdinando --,Negative
Still form a synonym for Truth. -- Cease trying!,Positive
"You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.",Positive
